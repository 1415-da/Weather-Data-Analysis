# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis Dashboard

This project is a weather data analysis dashboard built using **Power BI**, where I extracted both **real-time** and **forecasted** weather data using a **Weather API**, cleaned and transformed it, and visualized key insights to understand weather trends and patterns across locations and time periods.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Developed an interactive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard to visualize **temperature**, **humidity**, **rainfall**, and **wind speed**.
- Integrated both **Current** and **Forecast** data tables to compare real and predicted weather trends.
- Built dynamic KPIs, trend charts, and location-based filters to enable in-depth data exploration.
- This project was completed as part of a task from **Pianalytix Pvt. Ltd.**
